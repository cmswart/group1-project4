Final Project 
Requirements

Data Model Implementation (25 points)

A Python script initializes, trains, and evaluates a model (10 points)
The data is cleaned, normalized, and standardized prior to modeling (5 points)
The model utilizes data retrieved from SQL or Spark (5 points)
The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared. (5 points)
Data Model Optimization (25 points)

The model optimization and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance is documented in either a CSV/Excel table or in the Python script itself (15 points)
Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script (10 points)
GitHub Documentation (25 points)

GitHub repository is free of unnecessary files and folders and has an appropriate .gitignore in use (10 points)

Questions we want to answer

- Can we predict the starting salary of incoming employees?
        - Department
        - Age
        - Gender
- Can you use someone's age and projects completed to predict salary?
- Satisfaction Rate (Clustering)
         - Pitch idea to focus on certain employees that meet the criteria!
         - What is contributing to the satisfaction rate?
         - Possibly looking at certain countries or regions
Is there a correlation betweenâ€¦
         - Gender and Salary?
         - Age and Salary?
         - Productivity and Satisfaction Rate?
         - Joining Date and Satisfaction Rate?
